## Culture

### We embrace what makes us different and unique

We all have strengths and weaknesses. We each have our own experiences and stories.

We embrace these things so we can:

- Learn and grow together
- Think differently together
- Become better people together
- Advance our culture together
- Make work more meaningful together
- Build better products for all humans together

Hopefully we make the world a better place together, as well.

### We are champions for each other

- We work as a team to raise each other up.
- We raise each other up to work as a team.

### We strive for psychological safety

Team members should never be afraid to say:

- "I don't know"
- "I made a mistake"
- "I disagree"
- "I might be wrong"
- "I have a concern"
- "I have an idea"

### We strive for honesty and openness

Team members should never be afraid to say:

- "Our process is slowing me down"
- "I don't enjoy what I am working on"
- "I feel I am not set up for success at the moment"
- "I'm finding it hard to focus"

### We strive for efficiency

- Commit to a process, not a goal. Focus on what you will do, not on what you hope will happen.
- Ship code to production, frequently.
- Write the code that's needed at this moment.
- Resist urges to "fix" things that work and instead focus on things that donâ€™t.
- The more the code does, or the more specific the code is, the harder it is to reuse.
- Never reinvent a wheel when a perfect wheel already exists.

### We strive for accountability

- Mistakes are fine, but lack of effort isn't.
- Every member of a team must have the opportunity to make a mistake so they can become better at not making them.
- Accountability is not about taking blame, but improving our process for "next time".

### Democratic deploys

When appropriate, we collectively provide tools, guidance, and review code to ensure we understand why and how things are changing. But engineers own their own projects, test their own projects, create their own pull requests, merge and release their own code, and close their own issues.

---

## Approach

### Less is more

- Avoid frequent meetings and status updates. Instead lend support at critical moments, providing engineers the ownership that makes them feel happy and invested in their work.
- Always improve our process by reducing it. Bottlenecks and roadblocks frustrate engineers. When processes unnecessarily slow down work from getting done, engineers get discouraged. Process should only serve as a method to avoid or address bottlenecks and keep engineers unstuck.

### Product management

- Essentials before all else.
- Less is more.
- Feedback helps us improve the implementation of our vision, but does not dictate it.

### Project management

- Projects, not sprints.
- Estimate the effort required to complete each issue in a project to help us more accurately evolve our product roadmap.
- Code reviews before merging pull requests.

### Development

- Follow team standards that keep everyone on the same page and our process clean (branch naming, coding style, etc.).

## Team standards

> "Alone we can do little; together we can do so much."

Each product built by software engineers has different requirements, structures, frameworks, and methodologies cobbled together by a team. Standards are there to help team members stay on the same page, work together effectively, and create consistency throughout a codebase.

We can use them to keep code formatting consistent and readable or restrict certain anti-patterns from being used as best practices are determined. Code reviews can focus on the right things as linting automates catching the little things since rules are configurable and agreed on by the team. Lastly, they help us hold each other accountable to write code to the best of our ability. It isn't one person's code, it's all of ours. By holding each other to a high standard we make that code base stronger.
