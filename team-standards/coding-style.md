# Coding Style

To keep our team on the same page and writing code we collectively understand, we prefer to write code based on the following guidelines.

In general, we adhere to the [Google JavaScript Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/jsguide.html) and [Google HTML/CSS Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/htmlcssguide.html).

## JavaScript

- Use semicolons after every statement.

- Do not use [trailing commas](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Trailing_commas).
  - Cleaner code is better than cleaner "diffs".

## CSS

- Use alphabetical order for declarations.
  - This ordering is universally understood and easily maintainable.
  - Managing CSS at scale is hard. Anything that makes it more scalable between developers is better.
