# Releases

- We rely on [**semantic-release**](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release) for automated version management and package publishing.
- All Eleven21 platform product repositories have been configured to run **semantic-release** on any push or pull request that involves the `main` branch. **semantic-release** takes action based on [our commit message format](commit-message-format.md).
- We follow the [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) specification, which **semantic-release** adheres to, as well.
