We don't have a policy that dictates which IDE you will use, but our recommendations are below:

## VS Code

* [Install VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/mac)
* [Install `code` command in PATH](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/mac#_launching-from-the-command-line)

## Atom

* [Install Atom](https://atom.io/)
